# DUNECombinedGCN
Performs convolutions on three graphs representing the same neutrino interaction.

Each neutrino interaction is detected in three views and we want to treat each view as a graph. The network has four outputs that give the probability of the event to be: CC numu, CC nue, CC nutau or NC.

The dataset is exported from LArSoft and is currently created from the files on the fly
