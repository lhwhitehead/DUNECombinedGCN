# DUNECombinedGCN
Performs convolutions on three graphs representing the same neutrino interaction.

Each neutrino interaction is detected in three views and we want to treat each view as a graph.

Currently the network is to be tested on the MNIST data set to provide a proof of principle of the merging of graphs in an MLP.
